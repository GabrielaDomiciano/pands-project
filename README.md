## Introduction üëã üå∏
This is the final project of the Programming and Scripting course, during the course we learned how to program in Python, and perform data analysis, this project will allow us to put into practice the knowledge, being able to understand and learn how to perform data analysis in practice. 

The dataset shows a set of measurements of the petals and sepals of three flower species: setosa, versicolor and virginica.
The objective in this project is to do an analysis of the dataset, using the Python language.




## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To execute the codes, you must have Python installed on your computer. One option is to download Anaconda, which is a free package management environment. It already comes with all the libraries and packages needed to program in Python.

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com).<br>
[Pyhton](https://www.python.org).<br>
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org).<br>
[Numpy](https://numpy.org).<br>
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).<br>

I used as editor for Python: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).


## About this project üìä
Let's have a look at the Iris flower üëÄ

Inside the folder, you will find files that contain my analysis and comments on the dataset. Firstly, there is the 'comments.ipynb' file, which is a Jupyter Notebook where I recorded all my detailed comments and analyses carried out on the dataset. This file includes step-by-step explanations, insights, and interpretations of the data.

Next, we have the 'analysis.py' file. This file contains all the Python codes that were used to manipulate and analyse the data. Inside it, you will find the programming logic necessary to carry out the various operations and analyses presented.

Additionally, I have included the 'summary.csv' file. This file contains descriptive statistics that were calculated from the dataset. These statistics provide an overview of the data, including measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

Finally, you will also find 16 saved plots that were generated by the codes. These graphs visualize different aspects and relationships within the dataset, helping to better understand the data through visual representations.
